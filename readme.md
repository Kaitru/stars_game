# Stars Game

## This project is made just to learn bevy. Nothing special in it.
Seriously, it's a useless and unfunny game. You have zero reasons to play it.

But if you for some reason want to run it locally, you need `rust` installed and run these commands:
```
git clone https://github.com/Kaitru/stars_game.git # clone the repository
cd stars_game # go to the game folder
cargo run # compile the game (this may take a while because of bevy)
```
I only tested it on `Arch Linux` with `Vulkan` but it should probably work on other OS (idk).

## Controls are:
- WASD - move
- Space - Shoot

## Currently in game:
- Player movement
- Shooting
- Enemy spawning
- Enemy killing and despawning mechanics

## Planned features:
- Different enemy types
- Local score system
- Background
- Normal sprites?
- Main menu
